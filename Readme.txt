Multivariate Stock Price Prediction
Tools : Python, Keras API, Tensorflow backend
This is a multi-variate stock price prediction project. I have used keras api and tensorflow as backend. It can predict the starting price of next day share market based on its previous data. I have used one year data from share market and made a model to learn using LSTM(Long Short Term Memory). I have used multiple attribute to predict next day share market opening price.
